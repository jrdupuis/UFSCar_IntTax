## Popgen in R!
This is a tutorial to do basic population genetics in R, predominately using the library [adegenet](https://github.com/cran/adegenet). adegenet has some great tutorials for all kinds of stuff, and those can be found [here](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/wiki/Tutorials). 

The files here are a mix of my own data used in a couple publications about [hybridizing swallowtail butterflies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeb.12931) and the [melon fly](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-017-1621-z).
