# Introduction to command line

## Getting started
We're going to use the "Bash" version of the command line.

Linux: Open the program “Terminal” <br>
macOS: Open the program “Terminal” and run `exec bash` <br>
Windows: Install and open "Ubuntu" following the "Install WSL command" section [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command)

## Directory navigation
![Directory Structure](assets/linux_directory_structure.png)

Computer files are organized in a series of nested, hierarchical directories (folders) starting with the root directory. Each user has their own home directory where their files are stored. To distinguish files from directories, directory names end in `/` while file names do not.

### Paths
Each directory and file has a "path". Think of it as an address within the hierarchical structure. Paths start at root and go down each level until it reaches the directory or file. For example, the path to user1's desktop directory is `/home/user1/Desktop/`

For directory paths, the last `/` can be omitted, so the path to user1's desktop directory can also be written as `/home/user1/Desktop`

The path to your home directory can be abbreviated as `~`, so the path to user1's desktop directory can also be written as `~/Desktop`

Instead of typing the full name, paths can be auto-filled using the tab key. For example, typing `~/Des` `tab` will print `~/Desktop`

**_Question:_** Based on the above figure, why would `~/D` `tab` fail to auto-fill?

NB: Command line has a hard time understanding whitespace in file or directory names. For example, is `my file.txt` one file or two files named "my" and "file.txt"? Best practice is to never have whitespace in names. "my file.text" should be "my_file.text", "my-file.txt", "myFile.txt", etc. Also, do not include any symbols except for "-" or "_".

### Basic commands

`pwd` = "print working directory". It shows the path to the current directory, answering the question "Where am I?" `tree` provides a visualization of pwd.

`ls` = "list". It shows the contents of the current directory. To see information like file size or last access date use `ls -lh`

`cd` = "change directory", with the usage `cd /path/to/directory`. To move up one level use `cd ..`. To return to your home directory use simply `cd`

`mkdir` =  "make directory", with the usage `mkdir new_folder_name`. It makes a new directory within the current directory.

`cp` = "copy", with the usage `cp file_name copy_file_name`

`mv` = "move", with the usage `mv file_name /path/to/directory`. If a file with the same name already exists, `mv` will overwrite the original file without asking permission. To rename a file, use `mv file_name new_file_name`

`rm` = "remove", with the usage `rm file_name`. Note that command line does not have an "undo" function so deletions are permanent.

For directories, add `-r` to `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`. For example, use `rm -r folder_name` to delete a folder.

**_Task:_** Go to your desktop directory. Make a folder named "examples".

NB: If the command line gets stuck or you want to cancel a running command use `control + c`

NB: Command line saves a history of executed commands. Use the up arrow to go through your most recent commands; this is useful when you need to rerun the same command.

## Make and edit a new text file
Multiple plain text editors are available. We will use `nano`.

**_Task:_** Go into your ~/Desktop/examples directory. <br>
1. Open the text editor by running `nano` or `nano hello.txt` <br>
2. Type `Hello World!`<br>
3. Save the file `control+o` and use the file name "hello.txt". <br>
4. Exit nano `control+x`

We can also make a new, empty file from the command line using `touch new_file_name`

Did you catch the three ways to make a new file?
* `touch new_file_name`
* `nano`
* `nano new_file_name`

NB: File extensions are very important for understanding file contents. For example, a file named "sample1" could be anything, e.g., a text file with metadata or a fastq file with sequence reads. Naming the file sample1.txt or sample1.fq avoids this problem.

## Editing and viewing files from the command line
Files can be edited without opening a text editor. These command line tools have many options; we'll look at the basics.

NB: By default, the output of these commands prints to screen. If you want to save the output to a file, redirect the output by adding `> new_file_name` to the end of the command. For example, `grep "search_word" file.txt' > grep_output.txt` will redirect the `grep` output to `grep_output.txt` instead of printing to screen.

**_Task:_** Create a data file.
1. In your "examples" directory make a new text file named "log.txt".
2. Copy and paste the data below (use right-click to paste the text into nano).
3. Save the file and exit nano.

### Find text with `grep`
`grep` searches every line in the file for word(s) that you provide. If a line has matching text, grep will print that line to the screen; grep only searches for text and cannot make edits.

The grep format is `grep [OPTIONS] "search_word" file_to_search` <br>
The search_word must be in quotes and is case-sensitive.

**_Task:_** We want to know how many "ERROR" events are in log.txt. We can:
* Print every line with the word "ERROR" `grep "ERROR" log.txt` <br>
* Count the number of lines with the word "ERROR" `grep -c "ERROR" log_file.txt` <br>

### Find and replace text with `sed`
`sed` can edit text within a file. One common use of sed is find and replace.

The sed find and replace format is `sed 's/search_word/replace_word/g' file` <br>
Unlike grep, search_word is not in quotes but it is still case-sensitive. However, `'s/search_word/replace_word/g'` must be in quotes.

**_Task:_** Replace all occurrences of the word "ERROR" with the word "check".

### `awk`: it's complicated
`awk` is an entire programming language that can do the same tasks as grep and sed but also a lot more. 

One common reason to use `awk` is when you want to access data in columns. Columns are numbered from $1 to $n.

**_Task:_** Print column 2 of log.txt by running `awk '{print $2}' log.txt`

### Viewing files
`cat` prints the entire file to screen

`head -n <number> file_name` displays the first `<number>` lines of the file

`tail -n <number> file_name` displays the last `<number>` lines of the file

**_Task:_** Get the first two lines of log.txt.
___

## For loops
For loops can automate tasks when you need to run the same command on multiple files.

In Bash, the for loop format is:
```
for item in [LIST]; do [COMMANDS] $item; done
```

**_Task:_** In log.txt, replace the words "INFO" and "ERROR" with the word "okay" by running `for item in ERROR INFO; do sed "s/${item}/okay/g" log.txt; done`

A few things to note:
* The words in the list "ERROR INFO" are separated by spaces, not commas.
* "item" is a variable that changes meaning from "ERROR" to "INFO". Because of this special property, in the "do" part of the loop "item" is written as `${item}`
* Because of the `${item}` variable, `s/${item}/okay/g` is in double quotes instead of single quotes <br>

[LIST] can also be a file. In this scenario, each line in the file is a different item. The for loop processes each line until it reaches the end of the file

**_Task:_**  In log.txt, replace the words "INFO" and "ERROR" with the word "okay", but this time "INFO" and "ERROR" will be read from a list. <br>
1. Make a new text file named "search.txt" and list "INFO" and "ERROR" in a column like this:
```
ERROR
INFO
```
2. Then run `while read item; do sed "s/${item}/okay/g" log.txt; done < search.txt` <br>

A couple things to note:
* Since we are reading our search terms from a file, `for item in [LIST]` is replaced by `while read item`
* To input our search file, `< search.txt` is added to the end of the loop.
